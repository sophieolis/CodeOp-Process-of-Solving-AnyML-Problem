## Activity

1. Set up environment: install scikit-learn
2. Create a Github repository (in README.md format) to store the data science questions that you want to answer; this will serve as a cheatsheet for you!
3. [Read this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-master-scikit-learn-for-data-science-c29214ec25b0), and bring back questions about terms and concepts you do not understand.

## Activity Review

When students ask questions about the article assigned to read, answer their questions and place the concepts and terms within the flow of step-by-step guide or within the cheat sheet. The goal here is for students to map the whole picture of what ML is and its process.
